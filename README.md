**A hands-on guide to implementing Detection as Code**

## What is this book about?
This book focuses entirely on the automation of detection engineering with practice labs, and technical guidance that optimizes and scales detection focused programs. Using this book as a bootstrap, practitioners can mature their program and free up valuable engineering time.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the architecture of Detection as Code implementations
* Develop custom test functions using Python and Terraform
* Leverage common tools like GitHub and Python 3.x to create detection-focused CI/CD pipelines
* Integrate cutting-edge technology and operational patterns to further refine program efficacy
* Apply monitoring techniques to continuously assess use case health
* Create, structure, and commit detections to a code repository
